# Ruby
Auto bunny hopper written in Python.

## Warning
Ruby comes as is with no guarantees regarding its standing with VAC. This is a cheat and will get you banned if you attempt to use it on any cheat protected servers. I have only tested Ruby on private servers with VAC disabled and recommend you do the same. I do not encourage cheating in any form and made this solely to learn more.

* Python 3.4 (or greater)
* [pywin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32)
